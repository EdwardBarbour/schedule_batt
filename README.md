README for Testing_Battery_Scheduling_algorithms.ipynb

The notebook file contains two algoritms for scheduling battery operation

The first is cycleCharging and the second is priceDriven2

testData is included in the dir

The notebook also contains the code for formulating the battery scheduling problem as MILP formulation

THIS DEPENDS ON PYOMO AND CPLEX!!

To be able to run the notebook as is you need to install pyomo and CPLEX and sepcify your own path

This is not super straightforward, I'll aim to get a blog post up describing the process as well as formulating the battery scheduling MILP using pyomo 
Once I have that i will link here but in the mean time google is your friend.
